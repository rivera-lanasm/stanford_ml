convex opt

based on EE364 notes

2. Convex sets
norm balls
intersection of convex sets vs union 
positive semidefinite cone, the set of of symmetric matrices 

3. Convex Functions

first order condition for convexity 
tangent line as global underestimator

second order condition for convexity
iff f(x) is twice differentiable, and its hessian is positive-semidefinite

Jensen's Inequality
f(E(x)) <= E(f(x))

Sublevel Sets
alpha sublevel set
a-sublevel set is that in which all points f(x) <= a 

Examples
single var:
exponetial 
negative log
affine functions 
norms 

4. Convex Optimization Problems

global optimality in a convex problem
all local optima are global optima

Special Cases
Semidefinite programming

SVM - quadratic opt with linear constraints 
constrained least squares - quadratic opt with linear constraints
max likelihood for logistic - QP

Lagrange Duality 

complementary slackness / KKT

active constraints ==> support vectors
